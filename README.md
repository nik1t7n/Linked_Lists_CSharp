# LinkedListLab Readme

This repository contains C# code for implementing and testing various types of linked lists, including single linked lists, double linked lists, and circular single linked lists.

## Files
- `Program.cs`: Contains the main program with tests for the linked list implementations.
- `LinkedListsTests.cs`: Contains test methods for single linked lists, double linked lists, and circular single linked lists.
- `SingleLinkedList.cs`: Defines the `SingleLinkedList` class for single linked lists.
- `DoubleLinkedList.cs`: Defines the `DoubleLinkedList` class for double linked lists.
- `CircleSingleLinkedList.cs`: Defines the `CircleSingleLinkedList` class for circular single linked lists.
- `Node.cs`: Defines the `Node` class representing a node in the linked lists.

## Functionality
### Adding
- Adding nodes before the first node
- After last node
- In specific position passed by user
### Deletion
- Delete first node
- Last node
- Node at specific position passed by user
### Searching
- Search a node by passed value and get its position

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or any C# IDE.
3. Run the `LinkedListLab` project to execute the tests for different types of linked lists.
